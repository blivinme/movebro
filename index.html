    <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.[2][3] The browser was released outside CERN to other research institutions starting in January 1991, and then to the general public in August 1991. </p>
